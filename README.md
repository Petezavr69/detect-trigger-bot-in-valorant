 detection triggerbot in valorant
Greetings to all, there is a desire to make a script that could detect the use of a triggerbot in valorant (to compile a report at least). 
At the moment, I can't do anything specific, but we can work together.
I think the script should be done in such a way that it first records the time of the opponent's appearance (purple stroke), 
after it records the time of death and the script will calculate the time difference.
